## Question 2

For this question we want you to fetch data from a couple of endpoints on the server.  This data will describe the events of some people’s day (specifically 01/09/2018).  We’d like you to take that data, merge it together and render it as a JSON blob in the component.

There is a unit test that contains an expected output from the component. Getting this test to pass is the goal.
### What we're looking for

The goal of Question 2 is to see how our candidates reason the merging of multiple endpoints and produce a clean code solution. Our primary view will be on code readability and any performance compromises made. Including some extra tests would be beneficial as well as it would create an opportunity to iterate through the solution while trying to find a solution that is clear.
